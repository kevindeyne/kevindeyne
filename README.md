### Hello world ğŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer (he/him) with a passion for web, java, kotlin and writing. I always dabble in several side-projects (some in private repos, sorry).

Currently working on:
- ğŸ’­ A Java deep dive video series: https://bit.ly/3CiQUWp
- âœ¨ Medusa (active development), a modular front-end framework for Java: https://github.com/medusa-ui
- ğŸ”§ VardÃ¸gr (maintenance), a tool to generate test data based on real data: https://github.com/kevindeyne/vardogr
